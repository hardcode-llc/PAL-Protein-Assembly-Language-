# PAL Protein Simulation Demos

⚠️ **WARNING:**  

1. These demos are **for demonstration only** and may **not work**.  
2. They are **intended for simulation and educational purposes**.
3. Due to the `LICENSE` and legal documents, you **cannot release or use these proteins in real applications**.
4. For the **real version**, please **wait for the official release**.

---

## Overview

This repository contains **PAL (Protein Assembly Language) demos** for advanced protein simulations. Using a fictional instruction set, each demo simulates proteins targeting various applications, including:

- Disease targeting (Cancer, Alzheimer's, Diabetes, Heart Disease, Drug Resistance)  
- Environmental remediation (Oil cleanup, CO2 capture)  
- Material science (Self-healing materials)  
- Healthcare applications (Universal vaccine, Nasal spray protein)  

The system uses **IMPORT**, **CALL**, **IF/ELSE**, and **[NOTE] statements** to create complex, adaptive protein behaviors. Each protein outputs an **mRNA-like sequence** for demonstration purposes.  

---

## Features

- **Nested logic**: IF/ELSE statements simulate environmental sensing and adaptive responses.  
- **Multiple library modules**: `binding`, `signaling`, `motor`, `transport`, `modification`, `fluorescent`, etc.  
- **Visualization**: Fluorescent tags simulate monitoring protein activity.  
- **Escalation notes**: `[NOTE]` statements highlight critical pathways.  
- **Demo outputs**: mRNA sequences wrapped in eukaryotic-style format (e.g., `m7G-...-AAA(x98)`).

## Installation
  
1. Clone the repository:  

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/PAL-Protein-Demos.git](https://github.com/hardcode-llc/PAL-Protein-Assembly-Language-)
cd PAL-Protein-Demos
```

2. Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed.
3. Run the demo programs:

```bash
python main_demo.py
python next_gen_proteins.py
```

4. Observe the **simulated mRNA** outputs for each protein.

---

## Usage

- Modify or create new PAL code in `.py` or `.pal` files.
- Use `IMPORT` to include libraries.
- Use `CALL` to run predefined protein functions.
- Use `IF/ELSE` for adaptive behaviors.
-  Compile your PAL code with:

```python
from PAL import mRNA_Compile, wrap_mrna_for_eukaryotes

pal_code"""
# your PAL code here
"""

mrna = mRNA_Compile(pal_code)
wrapped_mrna = wrap_mrna_for_eukaryotes(mrna)
```

or in `.pal`

```pal
#your pal code here
```

## License

This project is distributed under a **sub-license**. See `LICENSE` for details. You may experiment, modify, and share demos **under the terms of the sub-license**. For a commercial or a third party use is prohibited until the **official version of PAL is made**. After PAL is made commercial or third party use is not prohibited but **the protein needs to be thoroughly checked** and **passed by the government**. unsafe use is **prohibited for release** and will **pay a fine / face lawsuits** for PAL is not for use that's unethical. The owner of PAL is **NOT** responsible for any unethical use of proteins from commercial or a third party. The owner of PAL is **NOT** responsible for any **injury/death** from PAL.

## Notes

- `[NOTE]` statements highlight critical or escalation routines in PAL code.
- These demos are **stepping stones for PAL system development** and the world.
- The **real version** will be released officially in the future.

## Conclusion

These PAL protein demos showcase the potential of **complex protein simulations** using a fictional instruction set.  While entirely safe and non-functional, they provide a foundation for learning, experimentation, and inspiration for future development.  Stay tuned for the official release of the real system, which will expand on these capabilities.
